# Word-Count

A simple word counter which sorts out words in a document and list them if they are a prime number.

## Stack

* JavaScript

* Jasmine (Testing framework)

* NodeJS (JavaScript runtime environment)

## Requirements
Install Node and npm from terminal

run commands:

```
$ cd root/of/your-project/
$ npm install

```

further instructions for running npm can be found here: https://closebrace.com/tutorials/2017-03-02/the-dead-simple-step-by-step-guide-for-front-end-developers-to-getting-up-and-running-with-nodejs-express-and-mongodb

## Tests

TDD using Jasmine as a test framework was implemented to methodically create programs charectaristics. To see the test results, open SpecRunner by using the following command:-

from the terminal, run command:
```
$ npm test
```

This will open up SpecRunner.html.


## Brief

 The test is as follows: Given a book in a text file

 (http://www.loyalbooks.com/download/text/Railway-Children-by-E-Nesbit.txt for example)

 1.Write an application that outputs the individual words that appear in the book, and how many times that word appears in the text file.

 2.The second part is to also output whether the number of times each word appears is a prime number.

 The following assumptions can be made:
 * Ignore punctuation and capitalisation
 * TDD is expected


## Development

I decided to use Javascript as the framework behind this project with NodeJS, this let me to show the results in a   human readable way. Testing was carried out through Jasmine using a TDD approach to methodically understand the next steps offering scalability to the test.

With time running out I did not have enough to iron out the issues with Node, but a bit more time I would have rectified this.
